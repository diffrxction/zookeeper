This is the final stage of the project Zookeeper.

This is a very very basic and fun small project. This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. The purpose is to create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

Note: The greater-than symbol followed by space (> ) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.

Your tasks at this point:

    1.Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, but now in a loop.

    2.Do not forget to include an exit opportunity: inputting exit should end the program.

    3.When the program is done running, it should print: See you later!


The final version of the program should run like this:
